OOP 2 - OO Concepts and PyGame
=======================

### Today 
- Introduction to PyGame through an example program from the PyGame book (McGugan, see below for a reference) 
- Modified to move object around by itself
- Add other objects
  - Show class diagrams
- Organize class into a hierarchy
  - Show inheritance in class diagrams
  - Discuss more general process and draw method (including the one following the mouse)


### OO-Concepts Covered
- Show more about relation between class and objects 
- Methods, attributes
- Inheritance
- Has-a vs. is-a relationships
- Abstraction
- polymorphy

### PyGame Concepts Covered

- Very rough description of events (enough for main loop and exiting the program)
- Blit
- Sprite
- Setting up a screen
- Tracking the mouse
- Moving objects around
- animation/time/frames, frame clock
 
### Resources

UML and class diagrams
- The oo-book
- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram)

UML is a large topic in itself. We will only cover a simplified version with simple diagrams in this course (more on this later).

Source code
- PyGame book. The source code from the book can be found on GitHub: https://github.com/apress/beg-game-dev-w-python-pygame
- [Code from the lecture](code) handed out in the gitlab repository after the lecture. 

The link to the PyGame book's GitHub repository was found from the book's information page:

Note that the PyGame book uses Python 2, while we are using Python 3 in the course.
